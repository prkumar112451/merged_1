Good morning Prabhat.
Good morning Himanshu.
It's James calling from Compass.
Hi James.
Oh this has been a nightmare.
Really sorry about what happened with the phone.
I don't know they're trying to get to the bottom of it but outbound calls seem to be working absolutely fine.
The inbound calls seem to be a little bit of an issue which we are working on.
So I appreciate you are quite tight on time with your training started in just a few minutes.
So is it okay to take the payment now and we can have all of the docs?
Absolutely.
Yes please.
If I can give you a credit card number that's fantastic.
Yeah that's absolutely fine.
So I'm just going to pop a reference.
It will be really and then really shock.
There's always patient surname and then clients surname.
So just to confirm it's the fixed fee investigation.
So the fifth of september and twenty five pounds.
The email address the one that we've been having correspondence on is that the best address for your receipt?
Yes that's the jacquiebsicad.com.
That's the one.
Yes.
So whenever you're ready Jackie I just need to take the name as it appears on the front of the cards you're using please.
It's J.E.
Brialy Shorrock.
Brialy Shorrock.
And that's with a hyphen.
Yeah.
Perfect.
And then whenever you're ready I would need the long credit card number please.
Okay it's four six nine three .
Perfect.
one two six four.
Yeah.
one five six three.
Yeah.
one two five two.
And the expiry date please.
is o six twenty seven and then finally. the three digit number is o nine five  . so they're just testing the fire alarms have you heard any noise in the background there so zero six nine sixe so I'm just going to try and process that payment for you now
Yeah perfect.
So that has all successfully gone through.
So you would have received an email receipt showing that you've paid Compass CAC Limited.
So what I'll do now is I will open the file I'll send it over to our coordination team and they will be able to send out all of the relevant documentation via email and it will all be sent out via ***** Class Royal Mail as well.
Okay so the email will arrive with you today and then the posted items will be with you in the next few days depending on the post in your area.
Okay so the documents are very straightforward.
However if you do have any issues you can contact our coordination team.
They'll be able to assist you with any questions or queries.
We'll allocate you the case reference number.
So just please make sure it's marked on any posted or email items.
We look forward to sending everything out and progressing matters on your behalf.
Jackie and again apologies for the issues we've had with the phones.
No problem we've got there in the end thank you yeah brilliant have a really good day and yourself bye bye now take care bye
